Jekyll.exe
==========

This is an effort to maintain small, portable Windows builds of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), built with [OCRA](http://ocra.rubyforge.org).

In the future this repo may contain build scripts, patches etc. For now, refer to [this blog post]() ***TODO*** on how it is built.

The source for the Jekyll project can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
